    <h3> Patricia Bonchek (née Patti Grace Mccrone), <br/>
      ex-California State University - San Marcos (CSUSM) Professor</h3>
    <p>Until recently, Professor Patricia Bonchek (née Patti Grace Mccrone)
    was a professor of sociology at California State University (CSU) San
    Marcos in California (<a target="_BLANK" href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/patricia-bonchek">more on her here</a>). She recently posted (and soon deleted) a large
    number of videos to the internet expressing her views on various
    subjects. Here are her views on "Asians":- </p>

	<p>(Keep in mind that American taxpayers and California state taxpayers, many of them Asians, are paying her considerable pension.)</p>

    <p>Some excerpts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> the Asian people have contaminated and polluted our land for
        eternity </li>
      <li> the Japanese are parasites, they are cockroaches, most Asian
        countries just are </li>
      <li> I want every one of you Asian cockroaches to get the fuck out of
        the United State of America forever </li>
      <li> for the next 100 years I don't wanna see another fucking pie
        face </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p> Some excerpts: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> message to all Asian human beings, stay the fuck away from
        America </li>
      <li> you fucking cockroaches </li>
      <li> you are contaminating our country and our people </li>
      <li> you are penalizing our American citizens because you are nasty
        cockroaches </li>
      <li> it'll take us maybe until 2030 to clean up the Asian cockroach
        mess we have in this country </li>
    </ul>
	<br/>

	<p>hed's take: IMHO, if you're an Asian student who studied under her, and are unhappy with the grade you received, you now have enough evidence to demand that CSUSM refund your tuition for that course. Additionally, all CSUSM students should demand better vetting for those who have power over them (and whose salaries they pay).</p>
